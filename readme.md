Note: 

1. Considering this as a quick assignment, There might be minor bugs and UI may not be an exact replica of the given image but I've done it to match around 98%. It can be 100% replicated if more time is spent.
2. Few coding standards and modularity might be missing as this was done in a single day. All these can be perfected with time :)

Installation instructions :

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
2. Run `react-native run-android` ton install app and start packager
